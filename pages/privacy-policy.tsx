          regulation. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the
          exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification
          by you, but doing so will not excuse your indemnity obligations.

          provision, we are not waiving our right to do so later. If a court
          strikes down any of these terms, the remaining terms will survive. We
          may automatically assign this agreement in our sole discretion in
          accordance with the notice provision below (our assignment to an
          affiliate will not require notice). Except for notices relating to
          illegal or infringing content, your notices to us must be sent by
